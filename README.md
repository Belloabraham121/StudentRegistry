## Overview

The `StudentRegistry` smart contract allows for the management of a list of students on the Ethereum blockchain. This contract includes functionality to add, edit, and view student information. Each student record includes details such as the student's name, age, height, and weight.

## Features

- **Add Student**: Add a new student to the registry with specified details.
- **Edit Student**: Modify the information of an existing student.
- **View Student List**: Retrieve a list of all students registered in the contract, including their indices, ages, heights, weights, and names.

## Contract Details

### Structs

- **Student**
  - `name`: A `string` representing the student's name.
  - `age`: A `uint` representing the student's age.
  - `height`: A `string` representing the student's height.
  - `weight`: A `string` representing the student's weight.

### State Variables

- **listOfStudent**: A dynamic array of `Student` structs that stores all the registered students.

### Functions

#### 1. `addStudent`

```solidity
function addStudent(
    string memory _name,
    string memory _height,
    string memory _weight,
    uint256 _age
) public;
```

- **Description**: Adds a new student to the `listOfStudent` array.
- **Parameters**:
  - `_name`: Name of the student.
  - `_height`: Height of the student.
  - `_weight`: Weight of the student.
  - `_age`: Age of the student.
- **Access**: Public.

#### 2. `editStudent`

```solidity
function editStudent(
    uint256 _index,
    string memory _name,
    uint256 _age,
    string memory _height,
    string memory _weight
) public;
```

- **Description**: Edits the information of an existing student at the specified index in the `listOfStudent` array.
- **Parameters**:
  - `_index`: The index of the student in the array.
  - `_name`: New name for the student.
  - `_age`: New age for the student.
  - `_height`: New height for the student.
  - `_weight`: New weight for the student.
- **Access**: Public.
- **Validation**: Ensures the provided index is within the bounds of the `listOfStudent` array.

#### 3. `viewStudentList`

```solidity
function viewStudentList() 
    public 
    view 
    returns (
        uint256[] memory, 
        uint256[] memory, 
        string[] memory, 
        string[] memory, 
        string[] memory
    );
```

- **Description**: Returns arrays containing the indices, ages, heights, weights, and names of all students in the `listOfStudent` array.
- **Return Values**:
  - An array of student indices.
  - An array of student ages.
  - An array of student heights.
  - An array of student weights.
  - An array of student names.
- **Access**: Public, view-only.
